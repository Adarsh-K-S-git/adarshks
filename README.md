# Hey there! I'm Adarsh K S ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a **Robotics and Automation** enthusiast with a passion for pushing the boundaries of technology! Currently, Iâ€™m pursuing my **B.Tech** at **Toc H Institute of Science & Technology** in Ernakulam, and I live for all things **space robotics**, **locomotion**, and **cutting-edge prototyping**. Whether itâ€™s building machines to explore distant planets or coding next-gen automation systems, Iâ€™m always ready to tackle a new challenge.

### ðŸš€ A few highlights of my journey:
- **ISRO Robotics Challenge 2024** â€“ Crafted a space rover with a robotic manipulator to traverse rough terrain and perform complex operations. As Technical Lead, I spearheaded a team of 10, and we secured a **top-19 rank** nationwide!
- **Srishti Robotics** â€“ Designed innovative image-processing algorithms and developed an Android app to monitor and control devices remotely. Yep, weâ€™re talking real-time updates and user authentication!
- **Bosch Rexroth Internship** â€“ Mastered **PLC systems** and delved into **pneumatics** and **hydraulics**, applying these skills in advanced industrial automation projects.

### ðŸ”§ What Iâ€™m skilled at:
- **CAD & Design**: SolidWorks, AutoCAD
- **Robotic Simulations**: ROS 1 & 2, RVIZ, Gazebo
- **Programming**: Python, C, C++, Arduino (and more!)
- **Creative 3D Modeling & Editing**: Blender, Premiere Pro, Photoshop
- **Platforms**: GitHub, Arduino IDE, Jupyter Notebook, and more

### âš¡ Always in motion:
Whether itâ€™s learning new tech, building robots, or writing cleaner code, Iâ€™m constantly leveling up. My interests span from **space exploration** to **machine learning**, and Iâ€™m always on the lookout for exciting collaborations and innovative projects.

Letâ€™s connect, create, and conquer the world of robotics together! ðŸš€
